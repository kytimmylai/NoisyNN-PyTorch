- [2024/01/28] Here is a useful [review](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ce0dDt9tUT) that provided from the [response](https://github.com/kytimmylai/NoisyNN-PyTorch/issues/1#issuecomment-1913511309). We've made a corresponding edit. I still have some other training cases, and my vacation is coming, so the reproduction may be late to M/Feb.

- [2024/01/20] Implement NoisyResNet

- [2024/01/16] Implement NoisyViT-B, quality matrix, and optimal quality matrix

## TODO
- Training
